# How to read examples safely

- All `*.vuln.example` and `*.fix.example` files are **inert** and intentionally **non-executable**.
- Treat examples as **reading material only**. Do not copy/paste into a runnable project.
- If you need executable labs, use a separate **private, isolated** environment under supervision.
